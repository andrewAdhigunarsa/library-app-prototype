        <h3>135 Years Of The Well-Read People Of The Library</h3>
        <p>

          As a family owned business and the oldest Australian-owned bookstore, The Library prides itself on meeting the leisure, learning and gift needs of all booklovers.

        <h3>Our Beginnings
        </h3>
        <p>
          The origin of the The Library flagship store on George Street – Sydney’s greatest bookstore – goes back to 1879 when young William Dymock commenced business as a bookseller in nearby Market Street. In 1922, the Dymock family purchased the site of the old Royal Hotel in George Street upon which was built the historic, Art Deco landmark The Library building, completed in 1930.

          As his business grew, William moved to larger and grander premises until, in the 1890s, he had a million books in stock. He died in his thirty-ninth year. Unmarried and childless, he left the business to his sister Marjory, who was married to John Forsyth. From that time onwards, the Forsyth family has managed The Library.

          In 1981, John Forsyth, William Dymock’s great nephew, decided to take over the company, selling his own successful printing and publishing business.

          As Chairman of the The Library Group of Companies, John Forsyth wished to preserve the company's heritage and great bookselling tradition whilst making sure it constantly reinvented itself and kept abreast of the changing Australian market.

          After investigating innovative book retailing concepts in the U.K., America, Europe and Japan, he returned ready to implement retailing concepts which were unheard of in Australia, and only recently introduced overseas.

          In 1986, the The Library Franchise System was set up, allowing people to have their own piece of this great bookselling tradition. Since this time, The Library stores have been successfully opened throughout the country. Following the opening of a store in Hobart in 2000, The Library opened its flagship store in Melbourne’s CBD in 2001 and in Brisbane in 2002 – completing the line up of flagship stores in all states.

          These stores, along with expansion into key metropolitan and regional centres, are part of an overall brand strategy to consolidate The Library’ market presence.
